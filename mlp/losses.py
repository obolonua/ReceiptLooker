"""
Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss
==============================

Purpose
-------
Measures how well the predicted class probabilities match the true labels.

The lower the loss:
    - the better the predictions
    - the more confident the network is about the correct classes

The higher the loss:
    - the more incorrect the predictions are
    - especially when the model is confidently wrong

Example
-------

Predicted probabilities:

    [
        [0.05, 0.10, 0.85],
        [0.70, 0.20, 0.10],
        [0.02, 0.15, 0.83]
    ]

True labels:

    [2, 0, 2]

Step 1: Select the probability assigned to each correct class

    Sample 1 -> class 2 -> 0.85
    Sample 2 -> class 0 -> 0.70
    Sample 3 -> class 2 -> 0.83

Result:

    [0.85, 0.70, 0.83]

Step 2: Compute negative log likelihood

    -log(0.85) ≈ 0.163
    -log(0.70) ≈ 0.357
    -log(0.83) ≈ 0.186

Result:

    [0.163, 0.357, 0.186]

Step 3: Compute average loss

    (0.163 + 0.357 + 0.186) / 3

    ≈ 0.235

"""
Softmax + Cross-Entropy
=======================

Purpose
-------
Used during backpropagation to efficiently compute the gradient of the
combined softmax activation and categorical cross-entropy loss.

Why combine them:
    - Softmax converts raw scores into probabilities
    - Cross-entropy measures how far those probabilities are from the truth
    - The combined gradient is simpler and more numerically stable than
      handling the two operations separately

What the backward pass does:
    - Copies the predicted probabilities
    - Subtracts 1 from the probability assigned to the correct class
    - Divides by the number of samples to get the batch average gradient

Example
-------

Predicted probabilities:

    [
        [0.05, 0.10, 0.85],
        [0.70, 0.20, 0.10],
        [0.02, 0.15, 0.83]
    ]

True labels:

    [2, 0, 2]

Gradient before averaging:

    [
        [0.05, 0.10, -0.15],
        [-0.30, 0.20, 0.10],
        [0.02, 0.15, -0.17]
    ]

After dividing by 3 samples:

    [
        [0.0167, 0.0333, -0.0500],
        [-0.1000, 0.0667, 0.0333],
        [0.0067, 0.0500, -0.0567]
    ]
